# LITA_Class_Documentation
This is where I documented my first project while learning Data Analysis with The Incubator Hub

### Project Title: Student Performance Factors

### Project Overview
---
This Data Analysis project is focusing on various factors that may influence student academic performance, specifically the "Exam_Score." Key variables include hours studied, attendance, parental involvement, and access to resources, among others. This overview will help in understanding the relationships between these factors and their impact on student performance.

### Data Sources
---
The primary source of Data used here is StudentPerformanceFactors.csv and this is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as kaggle or any other data repository site.

### Tools Used
---
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
   1. For Data Cleaning
   2. Analysis
   3. For Data visualization
      
- SQL - Structured Query Language for Quring of Data
- Github for Portfolio Building
- PowerBi for Data Visualization

  ### Data Cleaning and Preparations
  ---
  In the initial phase of the Data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following action;
  1. Data loading and Inspection
  2. Handling missing variables
  3. Data cleaning and formatting

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
  ---
EDA involves exploring of data to answer questions about data. To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset, I will; examine the data structure, check for missing values,and visualize key variables to understand their distributions and relationships. This will help identify patterns, trends, and potential issues in the data. Let's proceed with the EDA steps.
- what variables impact the performance of students the most
- what changes can be made to improve their performance
  
### Data Analysis
---
This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during your analysis;

```SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE Students
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```
